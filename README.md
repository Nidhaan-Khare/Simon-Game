# 🟢 Simon Game 🎮

A simple and interactive version of the classic **Simon Game**, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 📌 About

This is my first web-based game project where the user is challenged to remember and repeat an increasingly long sequence of button presses. The game tests the user’s memory and attention.
